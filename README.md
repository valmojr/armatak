ARMATAK is a server side Arma 3 addons for streaming unit positions to TAK Clients in sessions on real locations maps. It can be runned both as a clientside mod or a serverside mod, when runned serverside, it will create a TCP Socket connection between Arma 3 and the TAK Server, sending the game session information into it. When used clientside, Arma 3 will host a websocket server that you can connect to your phone and mock the phone's location to the player's in game location.
